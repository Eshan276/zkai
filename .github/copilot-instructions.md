# ZKai — Copilot Workspace Instructions

## Project Identity

ZKai is a decentralized private AI inference network built on the Midnight blockchain.
Users submit inference requests through an OpenAI-compatible API. Requests are authenticated
by a hosted gateway, routed through a WebSocket relay to a provider node, executed inside a
Trusted Execution Environment, attested on the Midnight blockchain with a ZK proof, and
returned to the caller — without exposing prompt content to any intermediary.

Live gateway: `zkai.vercel.app`

## System Layers

### Consumer
The caller: an SDK/Application, a tNIGHT wallet, or a raw API key.
Entry point: `POST /api/v1/chat/completions`

### Gateway · Vercel
- Authenticates requests (API key verification, wallet auth)
- Selects a provider from the registry (weighted by reputation and model support)
- Logs jobs to Neon PostgreSQL (`users`, `api_keys`, `jobs`, `providers` tables)
- Hosts the Consumer Dashboard

### Relay · Fly.io
- Receives HTTP POST from the gateway at `/relay/:provider_id`
- Maintains persistent WebSocket connections to all active provider nodes
- Routes the request to the correct provider over WebSocket
- Heartbeat every 30 seconds

### Provider Node · Docker Compose (two containers)

**zkai-enclave** — Python / Flask
- Runs Ollama inference: models `qwen2.5:1.5b` and `llama3.2:3b`
- Computes SHA-256 attestation of each response
- Exposes `/health` with hardware information
- Isolated by Gramine SGX / Direct Mode (TEE layer)

**zkai-bridge** — Node.js / Fastify
- Manages the Midnight Wallet SDK with LevelDB cache
- Payment Routes: `deductBalance`, `deposit`
- Registry Routes: `register`, `deregister`
- Attestation Route: `submitAttestation`
- Calls ZK Proof Server (`midnightnetwork/proof-server`, port 6300)

### Midnight Blockchain · Preprod · Compact Contracts
- `ProviderRegistry` — provider registration and discovery
- `PaymentEscrow` — shielded DUST payments
- `AttestationRegistry` — on-chain attestation anchoring

## Request Flow (6 steps)

1. Consumer sends inference request to the Gateway (`POST /api/v1/chat/completions`)
2. Gateway authenticates the key/wallet, selects a provider, logs the job
3. Gateway posts to Relay (`/relay/:provider_id`); Relay forwards over WebSocket
4. `zkai-enclave` runs Ollama inference, computes SHA-256 attestation of the response
5. `zkai-bridge` calls the ZK Proof Server, then calls `deductBalance` + `submitAttestation`
6. Transaction submitted to Midnight; response returns on the same WebSocket path

## Documentation Writing Standards

**Tone and style**
- Clear, direct technical prose aimed at developers familiar with Python, TypeScript, and cloud infrastructure
- No marketing superlatives — let the architecture speak for itself
- Passive voice only when the actor is genuinely unimportant

**Formatting**
- No emojis anywhere in any documentation file
- ATX headings: `#`, `##`, `###`, `####`
- All code in fenced blocks with a language specifier (`python`, `bash`, `typescript`, etc.)
- Tables for comparisons, parameter references, and stack summaries
- Horizontal rules (`---`) between H2 sections in longer documents
- One blank line between every top-level section
- Minimal badge row acceptable in root README only

**Content rules**
- Architecture documents must contain no fenced code blocks — describe flows in prose and tables only
- Setup guides must list every prerequisite, every command in order, and an expected-output note after non-trivial steps
- SDK / API docs follow: concept → signature → example → notes
- Every document ends with a "Related" section linking to other docs in the repo
- The architecture diagram lives at `architecture.drawio.png` in the repo root — reference it by that relative path from each document
